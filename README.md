# The implementation of the CMU 10-414/714: Deep Learning Systems course assignment
This is  my implementation of the DLsys course assignment. All code has passed the unit tests but has not yet been submitted to the remote grading system for evaluation.

The course, taught by Prof. Chen and Prof. Kolter, is designed to explore the foundational aspects of deep learning systems in depth. It provides students with a comprehensive understanding, covering everything from high-level modeling concepts to low-level implementation details.
